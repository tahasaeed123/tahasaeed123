# About me

Hello! 

I am Taha & in this doc you can learn a bit more about me and my intrests! I am currently working on getting my masters from Columbia in Data Science. 

At my core, I'm nerd who loves anime and math. I've worked with big ans small comapanies and have enjoied work most when given autonamy and agency in ambigous spaces. To me the most exciting thing is paving a new path and building modes of thinking with data anlytics.

I've spent the past the past 7 years at Google working across several funtions. Starting in sales where I partnered with a range of companies to build execute and find success with Google's Ad products.

I drove a data first approach to geo-targeting, audience selection, and KPI driven growth marketing. From there I transissioned to go-to-market strategy where I supported Directors and VPs to define strategic priorties, measure success, and align teams behind a single mission. 

Before my time at Google, I worked as a Fulbright Scholar in Malaysia - teaching english and researching their national vocational education program.

My current focus in investigating the crypto-twitter space to more structurally understand crypto communities using network analysis and NPL.
