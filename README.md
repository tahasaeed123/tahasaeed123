# About me

Hello! 

My name is Taha and I am a data scientist currently pursuing my master's degree from Columbia University. With seven years of experience in Google, I have developed a data-first approach to geo-targeting, audience selection, and KPI-driven growth marketing. In addition, I was a Fulbright Scholar in Malaysia, teaching English and researching their national vocational education program. My current focus is to use network analysis and NLP to structurally understand crypto communities on Twitter. With my analytical and domain knowledge, I strive to create strategies that can lead to success in unstructured problem spaces.
